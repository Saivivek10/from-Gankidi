## TypeScript Snippet - Async setTimeout Promise

This code snippet is a TypeScript function that turns *setTimeout* into a promise, allowing it to be used asynchronously. It takes a duration as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves after the specified duration.

```typescript
const timeoutPromise: (duration: number) => Promise<void> = (duration: number): Promise<void> => new Promise(resolver => setTimeout(resolver, duration));

```
